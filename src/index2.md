Qna:Understanding extends in TypeScript/JavaScript
In both JavaScript and TypeScript, the extends keyword is used to create a class that is a child of another class. This child class inherits properties and methods from the parent class, allowing for code reuse and a hierarchical class structure.
<!-- for EXAMPLE  go to index2.ts start 74 line-->

Qna:Understanding implements in TypeScript
Unlike extends, the implements the keyword is exclusive to TypeScript.
It is used when a class needs to adhere to a specific interface, ensuring that the class implements all the methods and properties defined in the interface. This is particularly useful for defining a contract that multiple classes can follow.
<!-- for example go to index2.js file -->
